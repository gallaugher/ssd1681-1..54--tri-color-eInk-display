# ssd1681-1..54--tri-color-eInk-display
The ssd1681 tri-color is a 200x200 display. It shouldn't be updated more than once every 3 minutes. In this demo I've connected the display using an Adafruit EYE SPI breakout (IMPORRTANT: NOT the eInk EYESPI. This one just uses the stanard EYE SPI used by other displays like OLEDs and TFTs). 
I've also added a button & LED light. When the light is on (after 3 minutes of updating) the user can press the button to toggle between a page showing information about the display, and another showing the Boston College athletic logo.
